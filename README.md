# Student Exam Performance Indicator

## Overview
This project aims to predict a student's math score based on various factors such as Gender, Race or Ethnicity, Parental Level of Education, Lunch Type, and Test Preparation Course. The prediction is done using a machine learning model trained on a dataset containing historical student data.
